## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API
<br>
<br>
I started out with the API section of this to make sure I could receive a NASA key that allows me to retrieve the images and descriptions from their database. Once that was in working order, I changed my button from a simple one time retrieval to the ability of retrieving data from any selected date in a calendar year. Finally, I upgraded the look with css.  

## Lessons Learned:

This came with its own set of challanges. I had to make sure the API worked and was retrieving the correcct data that I needed. I learned a lot about the API process in order for the flow of data to be displayed.
